# ProjectWingman_Autosplitter
Autosplitter for Project Wingman made by NitrogenCynic and Hilimii

# Usage
Download the main .asl file. In Livesplit, edit your layout and add a scriptable autosplitter under the control suboption. Select the file you downloaded and it should be good to go!

# Options
In Livesplit you can configure the following options for the autosplitter:

# Mission Mode
Autostarts the timer when gameplay begins, this is approximately 1.00s after pressing start to begin the mission. The value we use to do this is also present in the lowest level main menu, you may notice your timer autostarting whenever you launch the game or return to main menu.

Autosplits once at the end of the mission when 'Mission Complete' appears on the screen.

Autoresets every time you reset the mission. This will not work if you have completed a run and you haven't saved/cleared your splits.
# Campaign Mode
Autosplits once at the end of each mission.

No autoreset functionality.
# Campaign Mode - Campaign Auto Starter (Vanilla Only)
Autostarts the timer when you pick your difficulty and leave the lowest level main menu. Like before, because of the value we use to determine this, autostart will also trigger whenever you reset/complete a mission or return to the main menu from a mission.

This is disabled by default.

This only works for Vanilla runs. Does not work for the F59 DLC.
# Pausing Stops Timer
Pauses your timer whenever you pause the game during a mission.

Requires you to be comparing against Game Time in Livesplit in order for this to work.
